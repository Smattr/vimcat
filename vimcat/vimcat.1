.TH VIMCAT 1
.SH NAME
vimcat \- Concatenate files with vim-provided syntax highlighting
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B \fBvimcat\fR [\fB--debug\fR] [\fIFILE\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBvimcat\fR works like \fBcat\fR but uses ANSI terminal escape sequences to
syntax-highlight printed text as \fBvim\fR would.
.PP
All your typical \fBvim\fR configuration is applied by \fBvimcat\fR. That is,
your vimrc, ftdetect rules, after/syntax tweaks, ... \fBvimcat\fR quite
literally runs \fBvim\fR to display the given files and then renders the result
in your terminal.
.SH OPTIONS
\fB--debug\fR
.RS
Enable debugging output. This is generally only useful when debugging
\fBvimcat\fR itself. However you may find some of your vimrc settings cause an
unintended effect or deadlock, in which case this flag may help you discover
which configuration line is to blame.
